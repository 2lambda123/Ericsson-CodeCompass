=================================================================

Major changes happened in CodeCompass architecture which caused a huge
refactoring of the tool. The previous working version of CodeCompass is
available in the branch `Earhart` and the current version is being
developed on the `master` branch. The new version doesn't contain all
the features but we are continuously porting them.

**It is important that the Git hashes changed which breaks your local
repository. Please fetch the new repository again.**

You should use the `Earhart` version, but that won't be developed in the
future except for minor fixes. Bugfixes and further developments will
happen on `master` branch. User and development documentation will come
soon.
